# Am I Rich?

Am I Rich? is a simple Flutter application designed as a beginner-friendly project to explore the basics of Flutter development. The app displays a diamond image, symbolizing wealth, and serves as a fun way to get started with Flutter.

This project holds a special place as it is my very first Flutter application, created after completing Angela Yu's popular Flutter course, "The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart." The course provided a comprehensive introduction to Flutter and Dart, and this app is a testament to the skills and concepts I learned during the course.

Interestingly, "Am I Rich?" gained popularity not because of its features but as a symbol of being rich. It became a fun and quirky way for users to showcase their "wealth" by simply displaying a diamond on their screens. This unique concept made it a memorable app despite its simplicity.

## Additional Information

The "Am I Rich?" app gained cultural significance as a symbol of wealth and exclusivity. While it didn't offer any special features, its simplicity and unique concept made it a talking point in tech and pop culture. The app was famously priced at $999.99 on the Apple App Store, making it one of the most expensive apps ever listed. Its high price tag and lack of functionality turned it into a status symbol for those who could afford it, sparking debates about luxury and digital exclusivity. Unfortunately, there isn't a dedicated Wikipedia article for the app, but its legacy continues to inspire similar projects.
